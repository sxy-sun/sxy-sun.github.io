I recently earned a Master's degree from [University of Michigan Robotics Department](https://robotics.umich.edu/) in 2023. Before came to Ann Arbor, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/).

After graduation, I'm working as an R&D engineer developing next-generation MBot for the robotics department of the University of Michigan. I always enjoy learning more techniques while growing with this young and thriving discipline.
