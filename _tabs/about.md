I'm a second year robotics master's student studying at [University of Michigan Robotics Department](https://robotics.umich.edu/). Before came to Ann Arbor, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/).

Outside of school, I'm working as a robotics engineer developing an L4 autonomous indoor robot. Thanks to this job, I find my passion and future career entirely lie in robotics. I always enjoy learning more techniques while growing with this young and thriving discipline.
