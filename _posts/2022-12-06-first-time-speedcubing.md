Rubik's cube might seem like a hobby for some teenage nerds, but it is never too late to have fun with it.

Picking up Rubik's cube was also inspired by reading Andrej Karpathy's [website](https://karpathy.ai/), just like how I started this blog. He linked a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@badmephisto) on his website, bringing me to this million views Rubik's cube-solving [video](https://youtu.be/609nhVzg-5Q) he made a decade ago. And then the first time in my life, I learned how to solve a Rubik's cube. The photos below were taken on 11/2.

And then, about one month later, I finally got familiarized with all the steps in the beginner guide and managed to solve one in 1 min 33 s today. I know it is far from being called speedcubing, but at least I am working on it. Hope my next cube-related post will be me solving it under 1 min.

Here is a video of me solving the cube following the beginner algorithm.
