## English Version
### Two Degrees on the Same F1 Visa
I began my journey in 2018, applying for an F1 Visa for undergraduate studies at Rutgers University, issued by the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai. The visa was valid from May 4, 2018, to May 1, 2023. 

Unfortunately, during these five years, the COVID-19 pandemic struck. While holding this visa, I only managed to return home once during the winter break of 2019-2020. I graduated in 2021 and was admitted to the University of Michigan. My student visa was still valid, so Rutgers University remained on my F1 stamp.

It's legal for students transitioning from college to graduate school to stay in the US during the summer break, as long as the gap between the undergraduate program's end date and the graduate program's start date doesn't exceed five months. All you have to do is transferring the SEVIS record (I-20) to the new institution without the mandatory departure from the US. Just make sure you start the transfer before the 60-day grace period following your program's end date expires.

Later in 2021, with a new I-20 listing the University of Michigan, I still hold my valid F1 and have embarked on my graduate school journey.

### My First Ever Internship with F1-CPT
I was lucky to land my first internship after my first year in grad school and applied for CPT in 2022. The process was relatively simple, thanks to the University of Michigan's international office, which was super efficient in processing all the paperwork. CPT is managed by the university, so the experience varies from one institution to another. At UMich, you need to:
1. Complete an online workshop on Canvas and get an email confirmation.
2. Obtain an offer letter from your company.
3. Obtain a recommendation form from your department's academic advisor.
4. Attend an OPT seminar and get the ECRC work advisor's signature on the recommendation.
5. Have your I-20, I-94, and an unofficial transcript.

Then, submit all the above items to the University's portal, M-passport. The process was straightforward and free. At this stage, you don't need to deal with USCIS.

It's important to note that if your CPT exceeds 12 months, you automatically become ineligible for OPT. My internship was extended twice, running from May 2022 to April 2023 under CPT. I carefully tracked my CPT duration to ensure I didn't exceed the 12-month limit.

### My First Full-Time Job with F1-OPT
I graduated from UMich in 2023 and was fortunate to receive a full-time job offer from the robotics department as an R&D engineer. The job market was tough in 2023, and it seemed to only worsen over time. New grads from 2022, 2023, and 2024 all felt the impact of the economy and the apparent downturn in the tech industry. I felt incredibly lucky to secure a job with significantly higher job security compared to other options, which meant the world to me. 

For this job, I applied for F1 OPT and first time dealing with USCIS. 

F1-OPT Timeline (A total 88 days of waiting lol):
* I-765 Normal Processing Receipt Date: April/04 
* I-765 Approval Date: May/31 
* Card being produced: June/16 
* Card Produced: June/28
* Card Received: July/01

During my initial OPT application in 2023, there was a significant delay in EAD card production. In response, desperate OPT applicants created a Discord server to share information and support each other. Rumors circulated, based on some users' diligent calls to USCIS (which isn't known for its transparency), that the delays were due to a change in card vendors during this peak period (yes, in the busiest season). This situation put thousands of international students in a tough spot, with some even losing their job offers because they couldn't start work as scheduled. 

The rumor about changing card vendors was never officially confirmed by USCIS, leaving us in the dark about the true cause of the delay. It's really frustrating to see how little they seem to care about students hardwork to land job offers in tough times, but more interested in grabbing those application fees.

Starting in 2023, applicants waiting for their I-765 could opt for premium processing, which cost $1,500 and promised a response within 30 days. This left applicants with a choice: pay for premium processing or risk the standard processing fee of $410 and possibly end up paying a total of $1,910 if they decided to upgrade later.

On the discord server, we recommended newer applicants prioritize their mental health over their budget and opt for premium processing, no amount of money could compensate for the mental stress and lost job opportunities. Some followed this advice, paid the premium, and received their EAD cards much sooner than those of us who initially chose standard processing and were too late to switch. 

Note that, my initial start date for my job offer was June 12, I cannot start work on time due to EAD Card not yet received. Fortunately, the robotics department showed considerable patience in waiting for me. 

However, the calculation of unemployment days didn't stop. USCIS delayed my card production, but as soon as my I-765 was approved, they began tallying my unemployment days. Even more absurdly, they decided it is illegal to work with just the I-765 Approval Notice, forcing applicants to wait for the physical card—mine took a whole month to arrive. To make matters worse, we're only given a 90-day grace period for unemployment. Essentially, I was marked unemployed for 30 days, despite having a job and being eager to start.

So basically this:
- USCIS: "So, no job yet?"
- Applicant: "I do just wait for my EAD card arrival."
- USCIS: "Hmm, but if your I-765 is approved and you're not at work, sounds like unemployment to me."
- Applicant: "I'd be at work if you hadn't made it clear that working with just an I-765 approval is illegal."
- USCIS: "LOL, unfortunate, isn't it? Mark another 'unemployment' on the calendar."

**Thank you USCIS, very cool.**

### Cap-Exempt H1B

While the OPT application process was an absolute nightmare, I began working on July 10 and have been happy with my life ever since. Fortunately, my department sponsored a cap-exempt H1B, and three months before my OPT expired, my H1B petition starts. Although I still need to apply for OPT extension just in case, the robotics department's decision on H1B sponsorship really saved my sanity.

### 同一张F1签证，两个学位
我在2018年申请了罗格斯大学本科学习的F1签证，这个签证由上海的美国总领事馆发放。签证的有效期是从2018年5月4日到2023年5月1日。

遗憾的是，在这五年时间里，COVID-19疫情爆发了。持有这张签证期间，我只在2019-2020年的冬季假期回过一次家。2021年，我本科毕业并被密歇根大学录取。我的学生签证仍然有效，因此我的F1签证上仍然显示的是罗格斯大学。

从本科过渡到研究生的学生，只要本科课程结束日期与研究生课程开始日期之间的间隔不超过五个月，就可以在暑假期间合法留在美国。你需要做的就是将你的SEVIS记录（I-20）转移到新学校，而无需强制离开美国。需确保在你的课程结束后的60天宽限期结束前开始转移。

2021年晚些时候，拿着列有密歇根大学的新I-20，我仍然持有有效的F1签证，并开始了我的研究生旅程。

### 我的第一份实习: F1-CPT
2022年, 我很幸运在研究生一年级后找到了我的第一份实习，并申请了CPT。整个过程相对简单，这要感谢密歇根大学的国际办公室，他们在处理所有文书工作上效率超高。CPT是由大学管理的，所以不同学校的体验可能会有所不同。在密歇根大学，你需要：
1. 完成Canvas上的一个在线workshop并获得电子邮件确认
2. 公司的Offer Letter
3. 从你的Advisor那里获得recommendation letter
4. 参加一个OPT Seminar并获得ECRC工作顾问在recommendation letter上的签名
5. 你的I-20，I-94，和unofficial transcript


然后，将上述所有文件提交到M-passport, 这个过程很简单而且是免费的。在这个阶段，你不需要和USCIS打交道。

需要注意的是，如果你的CPT超过12个月，你将自动失去OPT的资格。我的实习延期两次, 从2022年5月持续到2023年4月都是在使用CPT。我仔细计算了我的CPT时间，确保没有超过12个月的限制。

### 我的第一份全职工作: F1-OPT
我在2023年从密歇根大学毕业，很幸运收到了Robotics Department的Offer，担任研发工程师。2023年的就业市场非常艰难，而且似乎随着时间的推移更加恶化。2022、2023和2024年的新毕业生都受经济以及科技行业明显下滑的影响。在这样的时期，我非常幸运能够获得一份相比而言更稳定的工作。

对于这份工作，我申请了F1 OPT，这是我第一次和USCIS打交道。

F1-OPT时间线（总共等待了88天lol）：
- I-765 normal processing 收据日期：4月4日
- I-765批准日期：5月31日
- 开始制作EAD卡：6月16日
- EAD卡制作完成：6月28日
- 收到EAD卡：7月1日

在我2023年申请OPT期间，EAD卡片生产出现了重大延迟, 于是OPT申请者创建了一个Discord服务器来分享信息。根据一些人对USCIS的电话轰炸，我们得到一个说法，即延迟是由于更换制卡供应商造成的（在最忙的季节更换供应商lol）。这种情况让成千上万的国际学生处于困境，有些人甚至因为无法按计划开始工作而失去了工作机会。关于更换卡片供应商的传言从未得到USCIS的官方确认，所以我们对延迟的真正原因一无所知。他们似乎对在艰难时期获得工作机会的学生漠不关心，唯一感兴趣的是收取申请费。

从2023年开始，等待I-765的申请者可以选择premium processing，费用为1500美元，承诺在30天内得到回应。这让申请者面临一个选择：支付premium processing费用，或选择normal processing费用410美元，如果他们稍后决定升级，可能最终支付总额为1910美元。

在Discord上，我们建议新申请者选择premium processing, 优先考虑他们的心理健康而非预算, 没有任何金额可以补偿精神压力和失去的工作机会。一些人听从了这个建议，支付了额外费用，并比我们这些最初选择normal processing并已经无法升级的人更早收到了他们的EAD卡。

我的工作最初的开始日期是6月12日，虽然我无法按时入职, Robotics Dept 还是非常耐心地等我。然而失业天数的计算并没有暂停。USCIS拖延了EAD卡制作，但在我的I-765被批准的那一刻，他们就已经开始计算我的失业天数。更加荒谬的是，他们决定仅凭I-765批准通知书工作是非法的，申请人必须等待实体卡的到来，我的卡片整整花了一个月才到。我们只被给予了90天的失业宽限期。尽管我有工作并且迫切想开始工作，我还是被标记为失业了30天。

所以基本上是这样的：
- USCIS：“还没有工作吗？”
- 申请人：“我有, 只是在等我的EAD卡来。”
- USCIS：“但如果你的I-765已经批准了，而你还没开始工作，听起来就是失业。”
- 申请人：“不是你规定仅凭I-765批准就工作是非法的吗???”
- USCIS：“笑死, 失业期+1。”

### 免抽签 H1B

虽然OPT申请过程绝对是一场噩梦，但我从7月10日开始工作以来一直生活的很快乐。幸运的是，我的部门sponsor免抽签 H1B，在我的OPT到期前三个月我的H1B申请开始了。尽管我仍然需要申请OPT延期以防万一.
