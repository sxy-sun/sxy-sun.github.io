# Measuring Temperature
[Thermistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor): a temperature-dependent resistor, changing resistance with changes in temperature. Since for some materials, resistance is a function of temperature, we have:

$$ R = f(T) \rightarrow T=f^{-1}(R) $$

- To compute T, usually there is a graph we could look up.
- They are very sensitive and react to very small changes in temperature. They are best used when a specific temperature needs to be maintained, and when monitoring temperatures within 50Â°C of ambient.

[Thermocouple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple): a temperature sensor that uses two different materials and measures voltage across two materials to measure temperature difference between hot and cold regions. It gives relative measurements.

$$\Delta V=\alpha \Delta T$$

- Change in voltage gives the change in temp, where $\alpha$ is material property, a constant.
- One of the most commonly used sensor for temperature. 
- [Thermocouple Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNoI62URtAk&t=2s)

Using both thermistor and thermocouple we will be able to measure the absolute temperature, since the thermistor can reflect its own temperature and the thermocouple can reflect the relatvie temperature.

Here in the image, we use thermistor to measure the block's temperature we call it `Temp(cold)`. Then we have two material stick out of the block to measure the temperature we are investing and we call it `Temp(hot)` here. The thermocouple will give the relatvie temperature $\Delta T$ and the thermistor will give $T_0$, and we can derive absolute temperature from them.

# Measuring Force
> How to measure force? You cannot directly measure the force but you can calculate it.

$$
\begin{equation}
R=\rho \frac{L}{A}
\end{equation}
$$

- R - Resistance, L - Length, A - Area, $\rho$ - Resistivity (Electrical constant)

$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A} \qquad \varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L} \qquad \sigma=E\varepsilon
$$

- $\sigma$ is stress
- $\varepsilon$ is strain
- E is called **young's modulus** which is a property of the material that tells us how easily it can stretch and deform.

To calculate change in resistance, based on equation(1)

$ \rightarrow dR = \frac{dR}{dL}dL-\frac{dR}{dA}dA+\frac{dR}{d\rho}d\rho $ 

$$
dR = \frac{\rho}{A}dL-\frac{\rho L}{A^2}dA+\frac{L}{A}d\rho
$$
Note that for most of the cases, the resistivity term could be neglected. <br>
Then divided by R:
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dR}{R}=\frac{dL}{L}-\frac{dA}{A}+\frac{d\rho}{\rho}
\end{equation}
$$
- Note there that the L is the original length and R is the original resistance.
- where $\frac{dL}{L}$ is *longitudinal strain* $\varepsilon_L$
- For $\frac{dA}{A}$ we need to account for *radial strain* $\varepsilon_r$, which needs *Poisson's ratio* $\nu$.
  - What is [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio)? - It is a measure of the *Poisson effect*, the deformation (expansion or contraction) of a material in directions perpendicular to the specific direction of loading.

$$
\varepsilon_r=-\nu \frac{dL}{L}=-\nu \varepsilon_L
$$
Plug $\frac{dA}{A}=-2\nu\varepsilon_L$ into equation(2) we have:

$$
\frac{dR}{R}=(1+2\nu)\varepsilon_L+\frac{d\rho}{\rho}
$$
- Since we have a content in the equation, we could have $\frac{\Delta R}{R}=G \varepsilon_L + \frac{d\rho}{\rho}$ where **G** is called **"gage factor"** which is a material property.

Such result, namely the change in resistance has linear relation with the strain, is used in products such as strain gage.


A **load cell** converts a force such as tension, compression, pressure, or torque into an electrical signal that can be measured and standardized. A **strain gage** is a sensor whose measured electrical resistance varies with changes in strain. 

What is the difference between *load cell* and *strain gage*? - A strain gage is a single transducer used to convert the mechanical deformation into readable electrical output. Whereas, a load cell comprises an array of strain gages that convert the mechanical load into readable units.

EX: Load Cells

$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A} \qquad \varepsilon = \frac{F}{AE} 
$$
- $\sigma$ is stress
- $\varepsilon$ is strain
- E is called young's modulus 


Then we have:

$$
\frac{\Delta R}{R}=G \cdot \varepsilon = G \cdot \frac{F}{AE} 
$$


How to relate force F to the change in resistance? Combine formulas we have above:

$$
F = \frac{AE}{G}(\frac{\Delta R}{R})
$$
