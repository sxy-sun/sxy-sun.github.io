# Measuring Temperature
[Thermistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor): a temperature-dependent resistor, changing resistance with changes in temperature. Since for some materials, resistance is a function of temperature, we have:
- To compute T, usually there is a graph we could look up.
- They are very sensitive and react to very small changes in temperature. They are best used when a specific temperature needs to be maintained, and when monitoring temperatures within 50Â°C of ambient.

[Thermocouple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple): a temperature sensor that uses two different materials and measures voltage across two materials to measure temperature difference between hot and cold regions. It gives relative measurements.

- Change in voltage gives the change in temp, where is material property, a constant.
- One of the most commonly used sensor for temperature.

Using both thermistor and thermocouple we will be able to measure the absolute temperature, since the thermistor can reflect its own temperature and the thermocouple can reflect the relatvie temperature.
