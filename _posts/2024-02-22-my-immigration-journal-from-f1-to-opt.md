> I just started my H1B process and decided to document my journey with US visas. This post covers everything from my first F1 to my initial H1B.

## Two Degrees on the Same F1 Visa
> F1 Visa is a type of non-immigrant student visa.

I began my journey in 2018, applying for an F1 Visa for undergraduate studies at Rutgers University, issued by the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai. The visa was valid from May 4, 2018, to May 1, 2023. 

Unfortunately, during these five years, the COVID-19 pandemic struck. While holding this visa, I only managed to return home once during the winter break of 2019-2020. I graduated in 2021 and was admitted to the University of Michigan. My student visa was still valid, so Rutgers University remained on my F1 stamp.

It's legal for students transitioning from college to graduate school to stay in the US during the summer break, as long as the gap between the undergraduate program's end date and the graduate program's start date doesn't exceed five months. All you have to do is transferring the SEVIS record (I-20) to the new institution without the mandatory departure from the US. 

Later in 2021, with a new I-20 listing the University of Michigan, I still hold my valid F1 and have embarked on my graduate school journey.

## My First Ever Internship with F1-CPT
> [CPT](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/students/f1-students/cpt) stands for Curricular Practical Training. It allows full-time students to legally work off-campus before graduation.

I was lucky to land my first internship after my first year in grad school and applied for CPT in 2022. The process was relatively simple, thanks to the University of Michigan's international office, which was super efficient in processing all the paperwork. CPT is managed by the university, so the experience varies from one institution to another. At UMich, you need to:
1. Complete an online workshop on Canvas and get an email confirmation.
2. Obtain an offer letter from your company.
3. Obtain a recommendation form from your department's academic advisor.
4. Attend an OPT seminar and get the ECRC work advisor's signature on the recommendation.
5. Have your I-20, I-94, and an unofficial transcript.

Then, submit all the above items to the University's portal, M-passport. The process was straightforward and free. At this stage, you don't need to deal with USCIS.

It's important to note that if your CPT exceeds 12 months, you automatically become ineligible for OPT. My internship was extended twice, running from May 2022 to April 2023 under CPT. I carefully tracked my CPT duration to ensure I didn't exceed the 12-month limit.

## My First Full-Time Job with F1-OPT
> [OPT](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/students/f1-students/opt) stands for Optional Practical Training. It allows students to work legally after graduation in the their field of study.

I graduated from UMich in 2023 and was fortunate to receive a full-time job offer from the robotics department as an R&D engineer. The job market was tough in 2023, and it seemed to only worsen over time. New grads from 2022, 2023, and 2024 all felt the impact of the economy and the apparent downturn in the tech industry. I felt incredibly lucky to secure a job with significantly higher job security compared to other options, which meant the world to me. 

For this job, I applied for F1 OPT and first time dealing with USCIS. 

F1-OPT Timeline (A total 88 days of waiting lol):
* I-765 Normal Processing Receipt Date: 04 April
* I-765 Approval Date: 31 May 
* Card being produced: 16 June  
* Card Produced: 28 June
* Card Received: 01 July

### My first direct  interaction with USCIS
During my initial OPT application in 2023, there was a significant delay in EAD card production. In response, desperate OPT applicants created a Discord server to share information and support each other. Rumors circulated, based on some users' diligent calls to USCIS (which isn't known for its transparency), that the delays were due to a change in card vendors during this peak period (yes, in the busiest season). This situation put thousands of international students in a tough spot, with some even losing their job offers because they couldn't start work as scheduled. 

The rumor about changing card vendors was never officially confirmed by USCIS, leaving us in the dark about the true cause of the delay. It's really frustrating to see how little they seem to care about students hardwork to land job offers in tough times, but more interested in grabbing those application fees.

Starting in 2023, applicants waiting for their I-765 could opt for premium processing, which cost $1,500 and promised a response within 30 days. This left applicants with a choice: pay for premium processing or risk the standard processing fee of $410 and possibly end up paying a total of $1,910 if they decided to upgrade later.

On the discord server, we recommended newer applicants prioritize their mental health over their budget and opt for premium processing, no amount of money could compensate for the mental stress and lost job opportunities. Some followed this advice, paid the premium, and received their EAD cards much sooner than those of us who initially chose standard processing and were too late to switch. 

Note that, my initial start date for my job offer was June 12, I cannot start work on time due to EAD Card not yet received. Fortunately, the robotics department showed considerable patience in waiting for me. 

What makes me even more furious is that as F1-OPT students, we are only allowed a 90-day grace period for unemployment. If we are unemployed for 90 days, the OPT status becomes invalid and we have to leave the US. While USCIS delayed my card production, the calculation of unemployment days didn't stop. As soon as my I-765 was approved, they began tallying my unemployment days. They decided it is illegal to work without just the I-765 Approval Notice, forcing applicants to wait for the physical card â€” mine took a whole month to arrive.

Essentially, I was marked unemployed for 30 days, despite having a job and being eager to start.

**Thank you USCIS, very cool.**

## Cap-Exempt H1B

While the OPT application process was an absolute nightmare, I began working on July 10 and have been happy with my life ever since. Fortunately, my department sponsored a cap-exempt H1B, and three months before my OPT expired, my H1B petition starts.
