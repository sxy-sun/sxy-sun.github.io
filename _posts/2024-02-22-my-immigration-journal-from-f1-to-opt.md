> Recently, I started on the H1B visa process, which inspired me to share my journey navigating through various F1 statuses. In this post, I'll dive into my F1 experiences starting with the F1 student visa back in 2018.

## Two Degrees on the Same F1 Visa
> The F1 visa is a type of non-immigrant student visa.

My journey began in 2018 when I applied for an F1 Visa to pursue undergraduate studies at Rutgers University. The interview took place at the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai, and my visa was issued, valid from May 4, 2018, to May 1, 2023.

At the time of the interview, I hadn't declared a major. Being undeclared meant a smoother interview process, as STEM majors—particularly from Mainland China—often face additional checks and typically receive shorter visa terms. Though, three years later, I graduated with a major in Computer Science. 

I was fortunate to receive a five-year visa, but during the five years, the COVID-19 pandemic struck. While holding this visa, I only managed to return home once during the winter break of 2019-2020. I then graduated in 2021 and was admitted to the University of Michigan.

It's legal for students transitioning from college to graduate school to stay in the US during the summer break, all you have to do is transferring the SEVIS record (I-20) to the new institution without the mandatory departure from the US. So I stayed during the 2021 summer as a huge lockdown was still ongoing in China.

Later in 2021, with a new I-20 listing the University of Michigan,  I continued my educational journey on the same F1 visa.

## My First Ever Internship with F1-CPT
> [CPT](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/students/f1-students/cpt), or Curricular Practical Training, allows full-time students to legally work off-campus before graduation.

In 2022, after my first year of graduate school, I was fortunate to secure my first internship and applied for CPT. The process was relatively simple, thanks to the University of Michigan's international office.

CPT is managed by the university, so the experience varies from one institution to another. At UMich, you just need to follow the insturctions on the university's [website](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/students/f1-students/cpt) and start early, the process is straightforward and does not involve USCIS.

It's important to note that if you used your CPT more than 12 months, you automatically become ineligible for OPT. My internship was extended twice, running from May 2022 to April 2023 under CPT. I carefully tracked my CPT duration to ensure I didn't exceed the 12-month limit.

At this time, my F1 visa remains valid, allowing me to leave and re-enter the US without any additional procedures. Although the pandemic restrictions eased in 2022, the cost of flights remained prohibitively high. A one-way ticket to China cost thousands of dollars, far beyond what I could afford. Consequently, I was unable to return home in 2022.

## My First Full-Time Job with F1-OPT
> [OPT](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/students/f1-students/opt) stands for Optional Practical Training, which permits students to work legally in their field of study after graduation.

In 2023, after graduating from UMich, I was fortunate to secure a full-time position as an R&D engineer in the robotics department at UM and applied for OPT with my new job offer. The job market was extremely challenging that year, affecting new graduates widely, particularly those from the classes of 2022 to 2024, due to economic downturns and tech industry struggles. 

### My first direct interaction with USCIS

| F1-OPT Timeline (88 days)    |      Date     |  
| ------------- | :----------- |
| I-765 Normal Processing Receipt Date |  April 4|
| I-765 Approval Date| May 31   |
| Card being produced| June 16  |
| Card Produced      | June 28  |
| Card Received      | July 1   |

During my initial OPT application, there was a significant delay in EAD card production. In response, desperate OPT applicants formed a Discord server to exchange information and support one another. Rumors suggested that the delays were due to a vendor change during a peak period, though USCIS never confirmed this. This lack of transparency left many international students in limbo, some even losing job offers because they could not start work on time.

In 2023, USCIS introduced a $1,500 premium processing option, guaranteeing a response within 30 days, compared to the standard $410 fee. On our Discord server, we encouraged new applicants to prioritize their mental health and choose premium processing to mitigate the stress and potential job loss caused by delays. I didn't opt for it as I couldn’t afford the fee and believed two months would suffice, based on the USCIS website’s average processing time of 1.5 months.

Unfortunately, my job start date was delayed from June 12 to July due to these processing delays. The robotics department was understanding, but the 90-day unemployment grace period began as soon as my I-765 was approved. This put me in a tight spot, as I was marked unemployed for 30 days, despite having a job and being eager to start.
> As F1-OPT students, we are only allowed a 90-day grace period for unemployment. If we are unemployed for 90 days, the OPT status becomes invalid and we have to leave the US. 

Not only did I lose unemployment days, but missing a month’s paycheck also plunged me into a financial crisis, as I was already financially independent from my family. Thankfully, my partner and a close friend helped me get through these tough first few months while I waited for my EAD card. I'll forever be grateful.

With the pandemic easing in 2023, flight prices to China fell to around $2,000, still expensive, but more manageable. However, with my F1 visa expired, I could legally remain in the U.S. but could not travel without risking a lengthy visa re-stamping process, particularly given my sensitive field of study. This risk made me hesitant to leave the U.S., fearing it could jeopardize my hard-won OPT status and new job.

To date, I have not seen my family for four years.

## Cap-Exempt H1B

While the OPT application process was an absolute nightmare, I started working on July 10 and have been happy with my life ever since. Fortunately, my department sponsored a cap-exempt H1B, and three months before my OPT expired, my H1B petition starts.
