If you’re a Costco Executive Member and mostly shop for groceries or fill up at Costco gas stations, the PayPal debit card is a no-brainer.

I’ve said before that credit cards are usually the best way to pay in the U.S. — thanks to rewards and added security — but when it comes to Costco cash back, the PayPal debit card is the real winner. You’ll earn **7% back on Costco shopping** (5% from PayPal plus 2% from your Executive Membership) and **5% back on Costco gas**.

Here’s how it works: the PayPal debit card gives you **5% cash back on one category** you select at the start of each month. Your choices are **restaurants, apparel, groceries, or fuel**.

Sounds pretty typical, right? Many credit cards offer 5% on these categories. But here’s the catch: most of them exclude Costco and Walmart. The PayPal debit card doesn’t. You get **5% cash back on all Costco and Walmart purchases**, including online orders.

And for gas pumping, choose “groceries” as your category, load a Costco Shopper Card using your PayPal debit card (and get 5% cash back), then use that Shopper Card to pay for gas at Costco. Boom — 5% back on gas too.
