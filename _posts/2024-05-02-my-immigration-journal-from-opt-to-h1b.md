> In my previous immigration journal post, I recounted my experiences with the F1 visa and concluded with the beginning of my H1B visa process. Now my H1B has been approved, this post is meant to document the timeline and the process.

Firstly, I want to thank my department, and all my colleagues for their incredible support throughout this process, also thank the university's lawyer and the international center for their efficiency and professionalism. Starting from the end of May in 2024, I will officially be in H-1B status.

As I work for a non-profit organization, I am on a cap-exempt H-1B. Unlike the cap-subject H-1B, which is essentially a lottery with a 20% success rate, the cap-exempt H-1B can be applied for at any time and has no numerical cap. 

Having cap-exempt H-1B actually limits my flexibility and career options, since I can only work for non-profits, unlike the broader industry which uses the cap-subject H-1B. Nonetheless, I consider this a positive step forward in my immigration journey, especially in these uncertain times where job security is paramount.

Here is the timeline of the key milestones:

| Date       |      Item     |  Note    |
| ------------- | :----------- | ----|
| 2/22/2024   | Filing of the LCA |[Labor Condition Application](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/fsis/filing-notice)|
| 3/04/2024 | Filing of H-1B petition | Petition sent to USCIS |
| 3/05/2024 | USCIS Received | Received Date on I-797C |
| 04/17/2024 | USCIS Approved | Notice Date on I-797A  |
| 04/22/2024 | Physical approval notice received | Valid To May 21 2027 |

The process involved numerous back-and-forth paperwork exchanges and emails among the lawyer, department HR, myself, and the international center. The table lists the major milestones, but there were many more steps and uncertain waiting periods involved.

The biggest challenge ahead is the visa interview. 

It has been 4.5 years since I last came home. Despite the risk of having a prolonged waiting time due to "administrative processing" (AP), commonly known as "long check," which is particularly concerning given my "sensitive" field of study, I've scheduled an appointment at the Shanghai US consulate for the H-1B stamping interview. Hopefully everything will proceed smoothly.

Below are the steps to schedule an interview appointment. While I find the DS-160 website quite straightforward, the interview appointment website seems somewhat hidden. Anyway, I'm attaching those websites here:
- **Step 1:** Fill out the DS-160 form.
  - [DS-160: Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/forms/ds-160-online-nonimmigrant-visa-application.html)
  - Please note that the DS-160 is a lengthy and somewhat tedious form, so be prepared to spend several hours completing it.
- **Step 2:** Make an interview appointment.
  - [USTravelDocs](https://www.ustraveldocs.com)
  - This website is simply frustrating. Avoid spending too much time on each step, as the website may kick you out or, worse, block your IP address for days.
