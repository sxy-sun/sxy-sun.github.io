My H-1B recently got approved, and I've scheduled a Visa Interview for July 2024. I want to have this post to document the timeline and the process.

Firstly thanks to my job, my university, my department, and all my colleagues who have been incredibly supportive throughout this process. I also want to extend my gratitude to the university's lawyer and international center for their efficiency and professionalism.

Although it took some time to get started, once things were in motion, they proceeded smoothly, and for that, I am grateful.

Here is the timeline:

| Date       |      Item     |  Note    |
| ------------- | :----------- | ----|
| 2/22/2024   | Filing of the LCA |[Labor Condition Application](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/fsis/filing-notice)|
| 3/04/2024 | Filing of H-1B petition | Petition sent to USCIS |
| 3/05/2024 | USCIS Received | Received Date on I-797C |
| 04/17/2024 | USCIS Approved | Notice Date on I-797A  |
| 04/22/2024 | Physical approval notice received | Valid To May 21 2027 |

There were numerous back-and-forth paperwork exchanges and emails among the lawyer, department HR, myself, and the international center, so the actual steps involved were more extensive than what the table shows. What I've listed in the table are the major milestones followed by uncertain waiting periods.

Since I have a cap-exempt H-1B, it can start at any time of the year, unlike cap H-1B that must commence in October. Therefore, starting from the end of May, I'll officially be in H-1B status. While this reduces flexibility for me and my career, I consider it a step forward in my immigration journey.

The biggest challenge ahead is the visa interview. I've scheduled an appointment at the Shanghai US consulate for the H-1B stamping interview, and hopefully, I won't encounter "administrative processing (AP)," commonly known as the "check."

Below are the steps to schedule an interview appointment. While I find the DS-160 website quite straightforward, the interview appointment website seems somewhat hidden. Anyway, I'm attaching those websites here:
- **Step 1:** Fill out the DS-160 form.
  - [DS-160: Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/forms/ds-160-online-nonimmigrant-visa-application.html)
  - Please note that the DS-160 is a lengthy and somewhat tedious form, so be prepared to spend several hours completing it.
- **Step 2:** Make an interview appointment.
  - [USTravelDocs](https://www.ustraveldocs.com)
  - This website is simply frustrating. Avoid spending too much time on each step, as the website may kick you out or, worse, block your IP address for days.
