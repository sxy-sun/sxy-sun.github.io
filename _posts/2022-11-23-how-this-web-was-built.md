After tried the templates from [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) and got confused with most of the fancy css settings, 
I gave up on writing progress with my learning very quickly.
Then somehow read Andrej Karpathy's [website](https://karpathy.ai/) about not using heavy frameworks and just focusing on the content, I decided to learn how to use Jekyll to generate everything, especially when it supports Markdown.

Thanks to Tim and his fantastic tutorial on how to build a website with Jekyll. Here is his [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/F8iOU1ci19Q) 
and [Doc](https://docs.technotim.live/posts/jekyll-docs-site/) that is super helpful. Following his tutorial and working on Ubuntu 20.04 with no issues.
