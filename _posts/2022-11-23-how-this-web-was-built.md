After tried the templates from [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) and got confused with most of the fancy css settings, I gave up on writing progress with my learning very quickly.

Then I got inspired by two blogs and decided to build a new one. One is [Andrej Karpathy's website](https://karpathy.ai/), where he mentioned not using heavy frameworks and just focusing on the content. Then I learned how to use Jekyll to generate everything, especially since it supports Markdown. Another was when I tried to use WeChat in docker, I came across [Lei Mao's blog](https://leimao.github.io/) and got inspired. His blog is so inclusive, from his research, work, and personal life. I think his content was amazing, it was so enjoyable to read, and I want to do something similar.

Thanks to Tim and his fantastic tutorial on how to build a website with Jekyll. Here is his [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/F8iOU1ci19Q) 
and [Doc](https://docs.technotim.live/posts/jekyll-docs-site/) that is super helpful. Following his tutorial and working on Ubuntu 20.04 with no issues.
